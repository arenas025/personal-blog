<P>
  Constantly, you are looking for the comfort in life, this mood that allows you to feel safe, that beautiful place that your brain loves, <b> that place that is a treasure in the short term but is your grave in the long term.</b>

<br/>

Yes, Iâ€™m talking about the <b>comfort zone, the worst enemy of your personal growth, and the paradise for your brain.</b>

<br/>
And clearly, there is a scientific reason that makes your brain and you love to be there
<br/>

Through time, as human beings, <b>our brains have avoided being in situations that seem dangerous to it, due to this we still exist as humans, it allowed us to survive through time</b>, so the brain seeks to be in comfort, it seeks just our survival 

<br/>

When you're in a mood that makes you feel secure and quiet, as your comfort zone, your brain releases dopamine and serotonin, hormones that lead you to happiness; Meanwhile, you're in an unfamiliar or uncomfortable situation, where you may feel either fear, anxiety or stress

<br/>

After you read this, maybe you're asking yourself. Why do I have to get out of my comfort zone? Well, let me explain to you why being there can be dangerous to you

<b> Familiarity isn't always good.</b>

<br/>
To improve, you must make efforts. To master a new skill, you must make both physical and mental efforts, hours of learning, practice, and perseverance and the only way to achieve this is to put aside your comfort, being uncomfortable, feeling those negative emotions which you often avoid. So, this is the reason you MUST get out of your comfort zone 
<br/>

<Quote author={'Jack Canfield'} quote={'Everything you want is on the other side of fear.'}/>

<br/>
If you remember when you learned to ride a bicycle, it scared you the first time because you left your comfort zone and gradually familiarized yourself with that until it became part of your comfort zone. What would have happened if you didn't get out of your comfort zone? surely you wouldn't know how to ride a bike.

<br/>

<b>The fact is to make your comfort zone as big as possible.
The bigger your comfort zone becomes, the more confidence and self-esteem you gain</b>

<br/>

Try to see if there is a specific muscle to break your comfort zone, this muscle is called courage and like a muscle, it can be improved. 

<br/>

But, how to do it? 

<br/>

<b>BABY STEPS</b>

<br/>

Try new things every day, make the discomfort your new friend; <b>allow your brain to become familiarized with the fear and all those negative emotions which keep you away from wonderful things.</b>
