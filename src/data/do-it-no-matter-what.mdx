<Title content={'Do it, no matter what'} />
<P> Sometimes we believe that is better don’t do the things that we want to do unless we get an optimal way to do it, or rather, until we feel enough prepared, but that is a lie. <b> You will never feel prepared, but you will be prepared earlier than you think.</b> </P>

<br/>

<P> Certainly, if we wanted to play the piano, we would have to practice a lot in order to learn how to play the notes, read the sheet music, and much more things, but you don’t have to be Ludovico Einaudi to do it, and if you think so, you are sabotaging yourself. <b>Without fail, mastery is impossible.</b></P>

<br/>

<P> Usually, the desire to avoid failure makes us fall into a mental trap, and it sounds like this: Unless you feel that you will do that perfectly, so is not worth doing; and ironically you will never feel that way. Always could be better, always there will be something to improve and so, that’s the main reason you will never be perfectly prepared. The perfect moment will never come and has never done it.</P>

<br/>


<P> <b> Is not about do it perfectly, is about to do it, fail, learn from it and improve.</b> Is to be aware that you will fail, you will make mistakes and despite it you can do it again. I would like to call it <b>“The mastery loop”</b> </P>

<br/>

<P> That’s the reason why I’m writing this. A lot of doubts around my mind. Will it be good? Will it be read? It’s been a long time since I don’t write in English, I’ve lost the practice and for sure it is not worth doing. <b> But the only way to answer and silence those questions and doubts is to do it</b>, otherwise you will keep wondering</P>
